## üìí **About**
This project was graded <strong>115/100</strong>.

The 42 school's Common Core final project is called `ft_transcendence`. Leveraging technologies like Javascript, Django, Docker and more, ft_transcendence is designed to introduce students to the world of web development, by creating their own web-application. It's purpose? To offer players the opportunity to play the old game of Pong.

As any other project, it has its own requirements. However, it's a bit more flexible regarding the features that can be implemented.

Transcendence is splitted into modules, each one approaching a different techology or concept.
As stated by the version of the [subject](./subject.pdf), we decided to tackle the following modules:

## üì¶ **Building**
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> You should have `Docker` and `make` installed.

After installing the required software, just run the following.

```sh
$ make
```

Other commands: 

- `make clean` - Deletes the whole database, database migrations and `__pycache__` folders.

- `make prune` - Same as running `docker system prune`.

- `make down` - Stops the containers.

- `make ps` - Lists the running containers.

- `make re` - Same as running `make down` and `make`.
